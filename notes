github
------------
git clone url
when you clone something that you have no rights for, and make changes, you send a pull request (you request that THEY pull your work)


git fork url
git clone FROM YOUR URL THAT THE FORK MADE
make some stuff in the fork
git add files
git commit -m mymessage
git push
ENTER git stuff


you can add things as remotes. Example: you forked from A and made B, you changed B to B', somebody pulled B' into A to make A' and then worked more on A' to make A''. You want A'' to be reflected in your B'.

git remote add "YOUR CALL FOR A NAME" [url of thing you forked]
git remote
git fetch ruddy
git pull ruddy master
you then need to push the things you've pulled from A'' to B' to make B''
